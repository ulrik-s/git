Native ODB API overview
=========================

Git's native object database (ODB) exposes `struct object_database` and
`struct odb_source` as the central data structures for working with local and
alternate object stores.【F:odb.h†L102-L160】 The API provides helpers to create a
database (`odb_new()`), attach paths as object sources, and read or write
objects through functions such as `odb_write_object_ext()` that operate on the
local repository's primary object directory.【F:odb.h†L169-L477】

A consumer that wants to experiment with custom storage can allocate its own ODB
using `odb_new()`, populate `struct odb_source` entries, and reuse Git's object
hashing helpers (for example `hash_object_file()`) to stay compatible with Git's
loose-object format.【F:object-file.h†L1-L126】【F:odb.c†L983-L1007】

Simple ODB example helper
-------------------------

The `test-tool simple-odb` helper demonstrates a minimal object database that
stores entries using Git's loose-object layout. It hashes payloads using the
repository's hash algorithm, compresses the `"<type> <size>\0<data>"` payload,
and writes the result underneath an `objects` directory it maintains on disk.
The helper exposes commands to initialise the store, append new objects, and
record the resulting directory as an alternate for the current repository so
that Git can discover the objects without further patches.【F:simple-odb.c†L1-L158】【F:t/helper/test-simple-odb.c†L1-L89】

The accompanying regression test (`t/t0039-simple-odb.sh`) uses the helper to
write and read blobs, verifying that repositories can read from the alternate
store via `git cat-file` once the helper has created the loose object and added
its path to `objects/info/alternates`.【F:t/t0039-simple-odb.sh†L1-L43】

Activating the helper via alternates
------------------------------------

The helper relies entirely on Git's existing alternates mechanism: adding the
simple store's `objects` directory to `objects/info/alternates` (or setting
`GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES`) is enough for Git to consult it during
object lookups. No changes to `odb.c` are required because the helper writes
objects in the same layout as a regular loose object directory. The test suite
demonstrates this by initialising a repository, adding the helper-managed
directory as an alternate, and reading objects through `git cat-file` without
any additional plumbing.【F:t/helper/test-simple-odb.c†L64-L89】【F:t/t0039-simple-odb.sh†L8-L43】

Comparison with other ODB APIs
------------------------------

* **libgit2** exposes an `git_odb` type with pluggable backends and callbacks
  that are registered globally. Implementers provide `read`, `write`, and
  iteration function pointers, but the integration is centered around a single
  multi-backend registry instead of Git's notion of one primary source plus a
  linked list of alternates.
* **gitoxide** (gix) models its ODB as a layered `gix_odb::Store`, combining
  a cache and multiple stores selected via configuration. Custom stores
  implement the `Store` trait and are typically used by wiring them into a
  `Repository` configuration object.

Key compatibility considerations
--------------------------------

Git's native API must preserve backwards compatibility with repositories that
may be accessed by older clients, so helpers should reuse Git's hashing
functions and object formats rather than inventing new on-disk layouts. The
example therefore hashes payloads with the repository's configured algorithm and
reuses the conventional loose-object directory structure, letting existing
clients take advantage of the alternate without special knowledge.【F:simple-odb.c†L63-L135】
